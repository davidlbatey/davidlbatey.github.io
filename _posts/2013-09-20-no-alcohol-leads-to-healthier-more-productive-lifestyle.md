For the last two months I have been living an alcohol free lifestyle, no mean
feat for a 20 something living in London. And I thought I would share some
of the benefits that I've experienced with you. I am not suggesting everyone
should do this, it's really hard to go teetotal, even for a couple of months, especially
if you live in a big city surrounded by temptation, all I want to do is highlight
the rarely considered impact of drinking.

First lets take a look at what a typical weeks consumption of alcohol looked like for me:

- Meeting friends at a pub twice a week, consuming around 3 pints of lager on each occasion
- One night out at the weekend. 2 pints of lager at a pub after work, 1/2 a bottle of vodka drinking with friends in a flat, 1/2 a bottle of red wine in a bar and 3 double vodkas in a night club.

As you can see it's a lot more than the four units I normally fill in on the
doctor's forms. Compared to my friends I considered myself a moderate drinker and
have never had an "alcohol problem", I rarely drank consecutive days for instance
and only drink with friends.

### Financial gains

So now let's crunch the financial savings by not drinking per week:

Midweek

```
2 * 3 * £4 = £24
```

Weekend

```
(2 * £4) + (0.5 * £12) + (0.5 * £15) + (3 * £8) = £45.50
```

So my weekly drinks tab came to around £69.50. So the total gain over the last
9 weeks is

```
£625.50
```
\- About a months rent or a London to San Francisco return flight

### Productivity gains

Now more importantly let's look at the time saved. No code shipped on the evenings
where drinking occurs (loss of 4 hours each night) and 1 day hangover on the Saturday
feeling sorry for myself.

```
4 + 4 + 4 + 12 = 24 hours per week
```

Which is a total productivity gain over the period of 216 hours or 9 days!!!

Even on the nights where I only have one or two drinks I generally feel less
sharp/alert the next day (maybe due to impact on sleep or hydration).

This productivity gain is also reflected in my GitHub commit count:

9 weeks prior to stopping drinking

```
494 code contributions
```

9 weeks since

```
718 code contributions
```

This doesn't take into account the lines of code or quality but it feels inline
with how much more productive I feel.

### Health improvements

- I've lost 5lbs without any notable change of diet or increase in exercise.
- I haven't had the mental lows that come the day after a night of drinking.
- Generally feeling clearer of mind, more confident and relaxed.

### Changing habits

If you want to cut back on your drinking here are some tips:

- If your drinking is mainly social like mine is then suggest to meet at a cafe or for food.
- If you do it to reward yourself after a hard days work then you need to try and switch it out for something else you enjoy e.g. reading/cinema/fruit juice.
- If it's to meet new people and make friends then try joining a sports/activity group.
