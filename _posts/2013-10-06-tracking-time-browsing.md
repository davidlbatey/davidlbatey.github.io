One of my friends recommended a great chrome extension called 'Web Timer' which
tracks how much time you're spending on different websites. He said that he
would frequently lose a few hours of time browsing while at work and not know
where the time had gone. Below is an example of the output.

I think being conscious of how you spend your time online is a good move to make.
Especially if it help you quantify the constant distraction from gmail, facebook, twitter, news sites.

I am sure there are lots of similar extensions, the next step for me would to limit access to the sites that end up consuming a lot of time vs value.
