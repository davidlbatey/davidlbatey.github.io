If you are anything like me you probably check your email 100+ times a day.
Over the last few months I have been trying to reduce the volume of messages received. Most of the emails were not providing real value and just a distraction/time
drain. Below shows my progress with a snapshot from July 2012 vs July 2013.

- July 2012: received 1,585 emails
- July 2013: received 1,150 emails

With a conservative mental processing time of 5 seconds per new email and
a 10% CTR with an additional 30 second reading time. The estimated time
saving is:

```
435 * 5s + (435 / 10) * 30s = 3480s
```

So by reducing the volume of emails being received I am saving around
**58 minutes** of opening and reading time per month. I think that the true productivity gain is actually many times the 58 minutes, which doesn't take into account
the impact of the email interruption on my work.

If you also want to reduce your email volume the messages that I targeted were:

- Businesses that had my email address from forms (cinemas, restaurants, travel agents etc...)
- Any that are not part of my core business i.e. Newsletters from companies (hubspot, salesforce, coursera, amazon, buffer) or regular emails (popbitch, change.org)
- Social accounts. Either unsubscribed from notifications or switched to weekly summaries
- Any that I regularly deleted or archived I unsubscribed from

To check your own email volume on gmail do a search for:

```
after:2012/07/01 before:2012/07/31
```

and then tab along until the end and you can see the count in the top right. I
think it's a useful exercise if only to get a snapshot on which direction your
own inbox is heading in.

### Outcome: 1 hour saved per month
### Downside: Less diverse inbox
