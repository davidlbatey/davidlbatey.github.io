	<p>There is a large opportunity for startups to compete in traditional industries by just cracking the customer service issue. The bar isn&#8217;t very high judging by how badly I&#8217;ve seen two large companies treating customers recently.</p>

<h2 id='natwest_httpwwwnatwestcom'>NatWest (http://www.natwest.com/)</h2>

<p>If you bank with NatWest and have an ISA account, you may have recieved a horribly worded email out of the blue explianing that your e-ISA will no longer be offered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If your Cash ISA balance is £1,000 it means you will receive £10 in interest per year instead of £17.50.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This shows a total disregard for their long term customers and an example of the hubris in these big corporations.</p>

<p>Fails:</p>

<ul>
<li>No communication of changes</li>

<li>Disregard for long term customers</li>

<li>Changing an account without my permission</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m planning to move my savings to another bank but I look forward to the day that a startup comes and shows these guys how to do it right.</p>

<h2 id='privilege_httpwwwprivilegecom'>Privilege (http://www.privilege.com/)</h2>

<p>I watched my father stuggle to get in touch with Privilege home insurance company today to make a claim. He spent about four hours on hold at different times in the day, yet if he called the sales line he could get straight through. When asked to be put through to someone that could help he was just repeatedly redirected to the support line and put in a long queue. This kind of behaviour must cause really high churn and someone that can improve this process will quickly find willing customers.</p>

<p>Fails:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can&#8217;t raise a request online</li>

<li>No notification of where you are in the call queue</li>

<li>Don&#8217;t care about providing a good service to existing customers</li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#8217;t think companies that behave in this fashion have long to change and I&#8217;m looking forward to the next generation of companies.</p>
