	<p>For the last two months I have been living an alcohol free lifestyle, no mean feat for a 20 something living in London. And I thought I would share some of the benefits that I&#8217;ve experienced with you. I am not suggesting everyone should do this, it&#8217;s really hard to go T-total, even for a couple of months, especially if you live in a big city surrounded by temptation, all I want to do is highlight the rarely considered impact of drinking.</p>

<p>First lets take a look at what a typical weeks consumption of alcohol looked like for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Meeting friends at a pub twice a week, consuming around 3 pints of lager on each occasion</li>

<li>One night out at the weekend. 2 pints of lager at a pub after work, 1/2 a bottle of vodka drinking with friends in a flat, 1/2 a bottle of red wine in a bar and 3 double vodkas in a night club.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see it&#8217;s a lot more than the four units I normally fill in on the doctors forms. Compared to my friends I considered my self a moderate drinker and have never had an &#8220;alcohol problem&#8221;, I rarely drinked consecutive days for instance and only drink with friends.</p>

<h3 id='financial_gains'>Financial gains</h3>

<p>So now let&#8217;s crunch the financial savings by not drinking per week:</p>

<p>Midweek</p>

<p><code>
2 * 3 * £4 = £24
</code></p>

<p>Weekend</p>

<p><code>
(2 * £4) + (0.5 * £12) + (0.5 * £15) + (3 * £8) = £45.50
</code></p>

<p>So my weekly drinks tab came to around £69.50. So the total gain over the last 9 weeks is</p>

<p><code>
£625.50
</code> - About a months rent or a London to San Francisco return flight</p>

<h3 id='productvitiy_gains'>Productvitiy gains</h3>

<p>Now more importantly let&#8217;s look at the time saved. No code shipped on the evenings where drinking occurs (loss of 4 hours each night) and 1 day hangover on the Saturday feeling sorry for myself.</p>

<p><code>
4 + 4 + 4 + 12 = 24 hours per week
</code></p>

<p>Which is a total productivity gain over the period of 216 hours or 9 days!!!</p>

<p>Even on the nights where I only have one or two drinks I generally feel less sharp/alert the next day (maybe due to impact on sleep or hydration).</p>

<p>This productivity gain is also reflected in my GitHub commit count:</p>

<p>9 weeks prior to stopping drinking</p>

<p><code>
494 code contributions
</code></p>

<p>9 weeks since</p>

<p><code>
718 code contributions
</code></p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t take into account the lines of code or quality but it feels inline with how much more productive I feel.</p>

<h3 id='health_improvements'>Health improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve lost 5lbs without any notable change of diet or increase in exercise.</li>

<li>I haven&#8217;t had the mental lows that come the day after a night of drinking.</li>

<li>Generally feeling clearer of mind, more confident and relaxed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='changing_habits'>Changing habits</h3>

<p>If you want to cut back on your drinking here are some tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>If your drinking is mainly social like mine is then suggest to meet at a cafe or for food.</li>

<li>If you do it to reward yourself after a hard days work then you need to try and switch it out for something else you enjoy e.g. reading/cinema/fruit juice.</li>

<li>If it&#8217;s to meet new people and make friends then try joining a sports/activity group.</li>
</ul>
