	<p>If you are anything like me you probably check your email 100+ times a day. Over the last few months I have been trying to reduce the volume of messages received. Most of the emails were not providing real value and just a distraction/time drain. Below shows my progress with a snapshot from July 2012 vs July 2013.</p>

<ul>
<li>July 2012: received 1,585 emails</li>

<li>July 2013: received 1,150 emails</li>
</ul>

<p>With a conservative mental processing time of 5 seconds per new email and a 10% CTR with an additional 30 second reading time, the estimated time saving is:</p>

<p><code>
435 * 5s + (435 / 10) * 30s = 3480s
</code></p>

<p>So by reducing the volume of emails being received I am saving around <strong>58 minutes</strong> of opening and reading time per month. I think that the true productivity gain is actually many times the 58 minutes, which doesn&#8217;t take into account the impact of the email interruption on my work.</p>

<p>If you also want to reduce your email volume, the messages that I targeted were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Businesses that had my email address from forms (cinemas, restaurants, travel agents etc&#8230;)</li>

<li>Any that are not part of my core business i.e. Newsletters from companies (hubspot, salesforce, coursera, amazon, buffer) or regular emails (popbitch, change.org)</li>

<li>Social accounts. Either unsubscribed from notifications or switched to weekly summaries</li>

<li>Any that I regularly deleted or archived I unsubscribed from</li>
</ul>

<p>To check your own email volume on gmail do a search for:</p>

<p><code>
after:2012/07/01 before:2012/07/31
</code></p>

<p>and then tab along until the end and you can see the count in the top right. I think itâ€™s a useful exercise &#8211; if only to get a snapshot on which direction your own inbox is heading in.</p>
