  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>
    The main motivation for wanting to increase my personal and professional
    productivity stems from the fact that time is valuable and I should be looking
    to maximise what I can achieve with mine. I also believe that the people who
    build the quickest and learn the fastest will ultimately "win" in the
    business sense, with that in mind I aspire to go faster.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like me you have probably read dozens of blog posts about a wide variety of
    ways to increase your productivity from business processes to meditation. Here
    I will attempt, where possible, to experiment with the latest productivity
    research and report tangible results i.e. hours saved or additional lines of
    code shipped.
  </p>
  <p>Some of the lifestyle and work areas I plan to experiment with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Alcohol consumption</li>
    <li>Hydration</li>
    <li>Diet</li>
    <li>Sleep pattern</li>
    <li>Exercise</li>
    <li>Stretching</li>
    <li>Meditation</li>
    <li>Reading techniques</li>
    <li>Interruptions/Notifications</li>
    <li>Work decisions - platforms and reusable code</li>
    <li>Delegation and recruitment</li>
    <li>Nurturing beneficial habits</li>
  </ul>
